# TODO-CLI

I needed to learn some F#, so I made a few small apps to do such a thing.

The code is ugly, and probably as fragile as my ego, but it works!

### Does it actually work?
~~Sure! I've tested it on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 (both WSL and physical hardware) and it works as expected!~~

~~And, as of August 2022, it runs on a Pinebook Pro, too!~~

~~Runs on .NET 5 and 6.~~

At this point, all I can say is that it compiles and runs using net8.0 on macOS Sonoma. I don't really use F# much these days...
